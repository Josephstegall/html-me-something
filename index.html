                <p> SXSW (said as South by Southwest) is a music, technology and film festival held in Austin, Texas. 
                    It is revered for being the premier destination to be discovered by the public as well as industry execs.
                    It is a meeting place for musical acts and artists, videographers, producers, actors and anyone else interested in the arts. Many people from all 
                    types of cultures and backgrounds converge on the city in droves, and have been doing so from about 1987!

                <h2 class="aligncenter font">What was <i>I</i> &nbsp;doing at SXSW??</h2>
                <p>
                    I have been interested in hip hop music, among other genres for about 20 years now. I am an
                     ametuer music producer and DJ, so it was only right that I made a trip to the Mecca of music festivals 
                     atleast <i>once</i> in my lifetime. I am also currently helping a friend of mine, <a href = "http://www.whoischrisjay.com">Chris Jay</a>&reg;, to break on the music scene.
                     He won a contest in Chicago, where the prize was to perform at a stage at the SXSW festival. So me, Chris and a couple other friends
                      got some buddy passes and we were <strong>OFF</strong>!!

                <h2 class="aligncenter font">What were our <i>RESULTS</i>&nbsp; of SXSW??</h2>
                <p>
                    We had an <i><strong>AWESOME</strong></i> show at SXSW and even had an impromtu second show the same night at a more popular club!
                    We got to meet some of our favorite rappers and Instagram celebrities! We partied very hard and had some major fun 3 nights in a row!
                    I'd say we had pretty good results!
